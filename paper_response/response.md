## Introduction

Ordinary mathematics can be formalized in

1. first-order logic
2. the language of set theory

in variants of

* simple type theory
* dependent type theory
* category-theoretic foundations

Another view of mathematical language: *controlled nature language*

Summary:
1. formalizing contemporary mathematics helps clarify the requirements that a good proof assistance must meet
2. engineering efforts to satisfy those requirements help clarify the nature of mathematical language and inference


## Perspectives

Aim: characterize mathematical language as it is used today

highlights:
1. features of mathematical language that have remained fairly stable over time
2. features of mathematical language that are relatively new

## Fundamentals

### Sorts

> objects fall into categories

objects are introduced into contemporary mathematics. 

Mathematical variables always range over a *sort*.

Objects belong to sorts.

The ascription of sorts to mathematical objects has specifically mathematical uses:

1. disambiguate notation
2. determine meaning
3. justify an expression as meaningful
4. support immediate inference
5. support higher-level inferences and heuristics



### Operations

### Predicates and relations
