Computing foundations are to be found not in the formal syntax 
and semantics of programming languages alone but princiapally 
as well in the abstract mathematics of the application domain.
In the future we will start there and map down to programs that
wil remain written in "lightweight" abstractions and languages. 

Formalized and automated abstract mathematics will provide a 
powerful new foundation for software-intensive systems of the 
future. Our most successful models of the real world are deeply
mathematical. As an example, physics rests on the mathematics
of topological manifolds. Such are the languages that have by
now proven most useful for describing (actual and potential)
states of affairs in world that we as human beings really care
about. 

Note: this comment presuppsed mathematics for all the fields
we care about, and that's not true. It's true for fields like
scientific computing, cyber-physical systems, controls, and so
forth, but probably not so much for human and social concerns.

Until recently -- and still mostly today -- abstract mathematics
has been largely a paper and pencil exercise, but we are seeing 
the emergence of rich libraries of formalized abstract mathematics
driven the the embrace of type theory foundations and constructive 
logic proof assistants by some parts of the mathematics research 
community.

As an historical development, their work follows the long history
of use of such tools in software engineering and languages research,
primarily for the specification and verification of properties of 
software. The mathematics research community has a different agenda:
to formalize and substantially automate reasoning across subfields
of abstract mathematical discourse. 

They key insight behind this effort is that we in the computer 
science community can now take advantage of what the mathematics
research community is providing, by using abstract mathematics in
automated forms for software development. That is, having helped to
sow a research in automated mathematics, we now propose to import
what they are producing to build foundationally verified, abstract
mathematical semantics for next generation software systems. 

As an example, we have developed an formal mathematical definition 
of affine spaces and their surrouding spaces of affine coordinate 
systems as a way to bring sanity to handling of multiple physical
dimensions and arbitrary coordinate systems imposed upon them, and
with automated translations between coordinate systems. But this 
is just a start. Hang around for more later.

As for the rest of this document, it's just a set of rough notes
from part of a course related to these ideas. It's not recommended
to spend much time on this material at this point. I'll be pulling
it together in the weeks to come.
