Sets
----

.. index:: set operations

If ``α`` is any type, the type ``set α`` consists of sets
of elements of ``α``.
This type supports the usual set-theoretic operations and relations.
For example, ``s ⊆ t`` says that ``s`` is a subset of ``t``,
``s ∩ t`` denotes the intersection of ``s`` and ``t``,
and ``s ∪ t`` denotes their union.
The subset relation can be typed with ``\ss`` or ``\sub``,
intersection can be typed with ``\i`` or ``\cap``,
and union can be typed with ``\un`` or ``\cup``.
The library also defines the set ``univ``,
which consists of all the elements of type ``α``,
and the empty set, ``∅``, which can be typed as ``\empty``.
Given ``x : α`` and ``s : set α``,
the expression ``x ∈ s`` says that ``x`` is a member of ``s``.
Theorems that mention set membership often include ``mem``
in their name.
The expression ``x ∉ s`` abbreviates ``¬ x ∈ s``.
You can type ``∈`` as ``\in`` or ``\mem`` and ``∉`` as ``\notin``.

.. index:: simp, tactics ; simp

One way to prove things about sets is to use ``rw``
or the simplifier to expand the definitions.
In the second example below, we use ``simp only``
to tell the simplifier to use only the list
of identities we give it,
and not its full database of identities.
Unlike ``rw``, ``simp`` can perform simplifications
inside a universal or existential quantifier.
If you step through the proof,
you can see the effects of these commands.

What is going on here is known as *definitional reduction*:
to make sense of the ``intros`` command and the anonymous constructors
Lean is forced to expand the definitions.
The following examples also illustrate the phenomenon:

by exact λ x ⟨xs, xu⟩, ⟨h xs, xu⟩
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Due to a quirk of how Lean processes its input,
the first example fails if we replace ``theorem foo`` with ``example``.
This illustrates the pitfalls of relying on definitional reduction
too heavily.
It is often convenient,
but sometimes we have to fall back on unfolding definitions manually.

To deal with unions, we can use ``set.union_def`` and ``set.mem_union``.
Since ``x ∈ s ∪ t`` unfolds to ``x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t``,
we can also use the ``cases`` tactic to force a definitional reduction.

Since intersection binds tighter than union,
the use of parentheses in the expression ``(s ∩ t) ∪ (s ∩ u)``
is unnecessary, but they make the meaning of the expression clearer.

/- TEXT:
It might help to know that when using ``rintros``,
sometimes we need to use parentheses around a disjunctive pattern
``h1 | h2`` to get Lean to parse it correctly.

The library also defines set difference, ``s \ t``,
where the backslash is a special unicode character
entered as ``\\``.
The expression ``x ∈ s \ t`` expands to ``x ∈ s ∧ x ∉ t``.
(The ``∉`` can be entered as ``\notin``.)
It can be rewritten manually using ``set.diff_eq`` and ``dsimp``
or ``set.mem_diff``,
but the following two proofs of the same inclusion
show how to avoid using them.

To prove that two sets are equal,

/- TEXT:
When it comes to representing sets,
here is what is going on underneath the hood.
In type theory, a *property* or *predicate* on a type ``α``
is just a function ``P : α → Prop``.
This makes sense:
given ``a : α``, ``P a`` is just the proposition
that ``P`` holds of ``a``.
In the library, ``set α`` is defined to be ``α → Prop`` and ``x ∈ s`` is defined to be ``s x``.
In other words, sets are really properties, treated as objects.

The library also defines set-builder notation.
The expression ``{ y | P y }`` unfolds to ``(λ y, P y)``,
so ``x ∈ { y | P y }`` reduces to ``P x``.
So we can turn the property of being even into the set of even numbers:
TEXT. -/
-- QUOTE:

def evens : set ℕ := {n | even n}
def odds :  set ℕ := {n | ¬ even n}

example : evens ∪ odds = univ :=
begin
  rw [evens, odds],
  ext n,
  simp,
  apply classical.em
end
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
You should step through this proof and make sure
you understand what is going on.
Try deleting the line ``rw [evens, odds]``
and confirm that the proof still works.

In fact, set-builder notation is used to define

- ``s ∩ t`` as ``{x | x ∈ s ∧ x ∈ t}``,
- ``s ∪ t`` as ``{x | x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t}``,
- ``∅`` as ``{x | false}``, and
- ``univ`` as ``{x | true}``.

We often need to indicate the type of ``∅`` and ``univ``
explicitly,
because Lean has trouble guessing which ones we mean.
The following examples show how Lean unfolds the last
two definitions when needed. In the second one,
``trivial`` is the canonical proof of ``true`` in the library.

As an exercise, prove the following inclusion.

the two notions agree, so you can always rewrite one to the other.

.. index:: bounded quantifiers

Lean introduces the notation ``∀ x ∈ s, ...``,
"for every ``x`` in ``s`` .,"
as an abbreviation for  ``∀ x, x ∈ s → ...``.
It also introduces the notation ``∃ x ∈ s, ...,``
"there exists an ``x`` in ``s`` such that .."
These are sometimes known as *bounded quantifiers*,
because the construction serves to restrict their significance
to the set ``s``.
As a result, theorems in the library that make use of them
often contain ``ball`` or ``bex`` in the name.
The theorem ``bex_def`` asserts that ``∃ x ∈ s, ...`` is equivalent
to ``∃ x, x ∈ s ∧ ...,``
but when they are used with ``rintros``, ``use``,
and anonymous constructors,
these two expressions behave roughly the same.
As a result, we usually don't need to use ``bex_def``
to transform them explicitly.
Here is are some examples of how they are used:

/- TEXT:
.. index:: include, commands; include

The ``include`` command is needed because ``ssubt`` does not
appear in the statement of the theorem.
Lean does not look inside tactic blocks when it decides
what variables and hypotheses to include,
so if you delete that line,
you will not see the hypothesis within a ``begin .end`` proof.
If you are proving theorems in a library,
you can delimit the scope of and ``include`` by putting it
between ``section`` and ``end``,
so that later theorems do not include it as an unnecessary hypothesis.

Indexed unions and intersections are
another important set-theoretic construction.
We can model a sequence :math:`A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots` of sets of
elements of ``α``
as a function ``A : ℕ → set α``,
in which case ``⋃ i, A i`` denotes their union,
and ``⋂ i, A i`` denotes their intersection.
There is nothing special about the natural numbers here,
so ``ℕ`` can be replaced by any type ``I``
used to index the sets.
The following illustrates their use.
