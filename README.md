Mathematics in Lean Source
==========================

This is the source code for
[Elementary Discrete Mathematics](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/).

Most of the source is written directly in the `.lean` files in `lean_source` 
using some simple markup. The Python script `lean_source/mkall.sh` then generates
the `.rst` source for the textbook and an exercise file and a solution file for 
each section.

You need to have
[Sphinx and ReadTheDocs installed](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

The following files are maintained by hand:
- The file `source/index.rst` should have an entry for each chapter.
- For each chapter, there should be a `.rst` file in `source`. It should include
  each of the sections.
- For each section, there should be a `.lean` file in the appropriate place
  in `lean_source`.
- Each section should have a corresponding line in `lean_source/mk_all.sh`.

Numbering in outputs is determined by sphinx labels

- \# with overline, for parts
- \* with overline, for chapters
- \=, for sections
- \-, for subsections
- \^, for subsubsections
- \â€œ, for paragraphs


If everything is set up right, the command
```
lean_source/mkall.sh
```
from the top level should build the restructured text files, the exercise files,
and the solutions. The command
```
make html
```
builds the html textbook and puts it in the `build` folder. The command
```
make latexpdf
```
builds the pdf textbook instead.

The script `deploy.sh` is used to deploy everything (the textbook and the
user's version of the example and solution files) to an arbitrary repository, set up to use the `gh-pages` branch
to display the html. Specifically, we use the following:
```
./deploy.sh leanprover-community mathematics_in_lean
```

The textbook is still a work in progress, but feedback and corrections are welcome.
